Quadprog-JS
===========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/erikbrinkman/node-quadprog.png)](https://travis-ci.org/erikbrinkman/node-quadprog)

This module contains routines for solving quadratic programming problems, written in JavaScript.
It is a strict fork of [this library](https://github.com/albertosantini/node-quadprog) that's been refactored to use modern array routines when they don't impact performance, use zero indexed arrays, and fit the standard formulation of a quadratic program, instead of the weird formulation that R uses.

Example
========

If we want to solve the equation:

```
min xT Q x + cT x
 st A x <= b
```

Then the following example solves it

```
const qp = require('quadprog-js');

const Q = [[1, 0, 0],
           [0, 1, 0],
           [0, 0, 1]];
const c = [0, -5, 0];
const A = [[-4, -3, 0],
           [ 2,  1, 0],
           [ 0, -2, 1]];
const b = [-8, 2, 0];

res = qp(Q, c, A, b)
```


Testing
=======

Base test cases are in json formatted files with the name `<name>-data.json`.
These can be passed into `solve.R` to create the standard R results for solveQP with the name `<name>-result.json`.
The standard usage is `Rscript solve.R *-data.json`, but you may wish to only create result files for specific tests.
The combination of these files is then used by `solution-test.js` and `bench.js`.


Adding Tests
------------

To add a new test simply create a file called `<name>-data.json` in the test directory, and then call `Rscript solve.R <name>-data.json` and commit the results.
